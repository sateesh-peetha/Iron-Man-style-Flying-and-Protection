## I am scrapping the below project as I am getting into lot of problems whenever I think of working on R&D. I may not have national feeling much but my work may be stolen in India. May be these was the reason that I am landing into unwanted problems. anyway no point to work on technology that can make India super power when I don't get respect from even labour who are much younger than me. what's the point if they don't give respect to me which I give to them.
